## **Part 0: Setup** 

You can continue from the previous lab. If you do, please commit your changes before proceeding. Alternatively, you can use the same workflow to generate a Docusaurus project:

```sh
npx create-docusaurus@latest week-nr-lab-nr classic
```

- When prompted, choose **JavaScript** (use the arrow keys to select and press Enter):
   ```
   Â» - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
   >   JavaScript
       TypeScript
   ```

- Change into the project directory and start the development server:
   ```sh
   cd week-nr-lab-nr 
   npm start   
   ```

By default, a browser window will open at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). To stop the server, use `ctrl + C` (on Mac, use `cmd + C`).
